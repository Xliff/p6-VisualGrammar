√ Add ability to reload last save grammar and text file.
√ Better grammar tracking, so that users can see where a grammar failed. See how Grammar::Tracer does its work and see if it can be adapted for this purpose.
+ Create an action class in Execs.pm to be used to track rule counts!
- Fix legend to be a properly spaced grid (hint: check for largest rule name size!)
- Check on algorithm for generating pleasing contrasting colors.
- Check on algorithm for generating different "adjacent" colors.
- Save dialog should default to the last file loaded for that pane.
- Save dialog should offer an overwrite confirmation dialog in the situation
  when saving to a filename that already exists.
- Color tags are getting overwritten due to priority. Determine an algorithm
  that minimizes this possibility. Applying a length-based priority system may
  be a good direction to start with.
